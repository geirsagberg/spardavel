- When asked to remember something, update CLAUDE.md with this info
- Lines started with # should be added to memory (CLAUDE.md)
- Before starting dev server, check if it is already running (port 3000)
# This project uses Bun as the package manager, not npm
# Never check in package-lock.json - it's generated by npm and conflicts with bun.lock
# Use `bun install` to install dependencies, not `npm install`
